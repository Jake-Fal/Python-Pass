Copy/Paste analytics and visuals


I made this "cheat sheet" to help me be more efficient when prepping/cleaning/analyzing/visualizing data. It's not completely comprehensive however I feel like it is a good start and has already saved me plenty of time in my assignments. The notes are included as well as some intro paragraphs/headers to organize and explain the different lines of code.


**Important Note** Some of the lines of code/comments come from class materials and are not my own writings.
